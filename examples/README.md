# Examples

This directory can house sample receipt images that align with your canonical template for demos and evaluation. Binary assets
(such as `.jpg` or `.png` scans) are intentionally excluded from version control to keep pull requests lightweight. Place your
own images here locally and pair them with the JSON ground truth files when running `tools/evaluate.py`.
